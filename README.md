# PolyVector
Testdriving polymorphism for vector-like structures

Implemented are:

1. Dynamic buffer
2. Static First-In-First-Out Buffer
3. Static Last-In-First-Out Buffer
4. Static First-In-First-Out Ringbuffer
4. Threadsafe Static First-In-First-Out Ringbuffer

Make vectors with vecnew, vecclone. Destroy them with vecdestroy.
Add items with push, pushback, pushfront, set, insert or safe_push in case of threadsafe usage.
Get items with peek, peekback, peekfront, get or safe_pop in case of threadsafe usage.
Destroy items with pop, popback, popfront or remove.

See tests for examples.
